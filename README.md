healthcare website framework

Overview

This is a modern, responsive, and visually appealing website prototype for a US-based healthcare company. It is designed to showcase a professional online presence and can serve as the framework for a fully functional website.

This prototype was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (or React) and demonstrates the layout, design, and structure of the website. No backend functionality is included, so all content and interactions are for demonstration purposes only.
